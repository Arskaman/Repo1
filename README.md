FightToTheDeath.

How to play?

Program asks user to give a names for fighter 1 and fighter 2.
Then those take turns to hit and block eachother, value is random in certain range.
when someones energy is draided to zero, that unlucky fighter dies and other wins.


What next?

Next step to take is make 3 fighter classes wich user can choose. (with different energy, attack and block ranges)

Program is made from examples and frustration.
