FightToTheDeath.

Program asks user to give a name for fighter 1 and after that fighter 2.
Then those take turns to hit and block eachother, value is random in certain range.
when someones energy is draided to zero. that guy dies and other wins the fight.

Next step to take is make 3 fighter classes wich user can choose. (with different energy, attac and block ranges)

Program is made from examples and frustration.
